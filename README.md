A refreshing programming language for the front-end web, aiming to solve the most common issues of **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** at a language level:

- Reusable components
- Styling
- Routing
- Global and local state handling
- Synchronous and asynchronous computations that might fail

While focusing on:

- Developer happiness
- Fast compilation
- Readability

## Project Status

The project is in development, we are still tweaking the language and standard library.

There are some bigger applications which can be used as examples / learning material:

- [Mint Realworld](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-realworld) (~3300 LOC) 
- [Mint UI](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-ui) (~9500 LOC)
- [Mint UI Website](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-ui) (~27256 LOC)

## Installing

## Contributing

Read the general [Contributing guide](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and then:

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

### Ways you can contribute

- **use the language** - this is the most helpful thing at this stage because we can discover bugs and missing features this way
- **documentation and website** - the documentation always needs some work, if you discover that something is not documented or can be improved you can create a PR for it in the [website repository](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-website-rails)
- **language features** - if you have any idea about a new language feature, create a detailed issue about it with examples and description (why is it needed? what problems does it solve?)
- **code review** - the compiler can use a thorough code review, also code reviews for PRs are welcome
- **standard library** - the standard library is incomplete and needs a lot of work:
  - create modules for not yet implemented Web APIs (or a separate package)
  - a lot of modules like `String`, `Dom`, etc... are missing a lot of features, you can add new functions here (with tests)
- **write a package** - if you have a feature you use and can be moved into a package it can be good for other developers
- **marketing** - write blog posts and such to help others become aware of the language
- **compiler** - there are a few issues that could be fixed and features that can be implemented in the compiler
